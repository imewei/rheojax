# Tutorial Notebooks Have Moved!

**The example notebooks have been reorganized and moved to a new location.**

## New Location

All tutorial notebooks are now in the `examples/` directory at the project root:

```
Rheo/
â””â”€â”€ examples/
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Complete tutorial guide
    â”œâ”€â”€ basic/                 # Basic model fitting (5 notebooks)
    â”œâ”€â”€ transforms/            # Data analysis workflows (6 notebooks)
    â”œâ”€â”€ bayesian/              # Bayesian inference (5 notebooks)
    â””â”€â”€ advanced/              # Advanced patterns (6 notebooks)
```

## Migration Guide

### For Users with Bookmarks

**Update your bookmarks from:**
```
docs/examples/
```

**To:**
```
examples/
```

### Notebook Mapping

Legacy notebooks have been replaced with improved versions:

| Legacy (`docs/examples/`) | New Location (`examples/`) | Status |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| `basic_model_fitting.ipynb` | `basic/01-maxwell-fitting.ipynb`<br>`basic/02-zener-fitting.ipynb`<br>`basic/03-springpot-fitting.ipynb` | âœ… Superseded by 3 focused notebooks |
| `mastercurve_generation.ipynb` | `transforms/02b-mastercurve-wlf-validation.ipynb` | âœ… Migrated with improvements |
| `multi_model_comparison.ipynb` | `advanced/06-frequentist-model-selection.ipynb` | âœ… Migrated (AIC/BIC model selection) |
| `multi_technique_fitting.ipynb` | `advanced/01-multi-technique-fitting.ipynb` | âœ… Covered in new comprehensive version |
| `advanced_workflows.ipynb` | `advanced/03-custom-models.ipynb`<br>`advanced/05-performance-optimization.ipynb` | âœ… Core concepts integrated |

### For Scripts and Automation

If you have scripts referencing the old location, update your paths:

```python
# Old
notebook_path = "docs/examples/basic_model_fitting.ipynb"

# New - See examples/README.md for complete listing
notebook_path = "examples/basic/01-maxwell-fitting.ipynb"
```

### What's New?

The new tutorial structure provides:

âœ… **22 comprehensive notebooks** (vs 5 legacy notebooks)
âœ… **4 clear learning paths**: Basic â†’ Transforms â†’ Bayesian â†’ Advanced
âœ… **13-16 hours of content** with estimated completion times
âœ… **Better organization** by topic and difficulty
âœ… **More depth** with focused notebooks per model/technique
âœ… **Improved documentation** with learning objectives and prerequisites
